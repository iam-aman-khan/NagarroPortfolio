<p style="margin-top: -18%;">Ash celebrates making it to the Kanto League back at Pallet Town. However, Team Rocket steals Pikachu by tricking them with a very spicy meal, but unlucky for them they're defeated by Charizard, but only after Ash's Pidgeotto is poisoned. Later on, Professor Oak asks Ash to go to Valencia Island to bring a mysterious Pokéball, the GS Ball, from Professor Ivy. Ash prepares for his journey to Valencia Island, when they are attacked by a group of Spearow and a very angry Fearow. Ash realizes that the Spearow Ash threw the rock at in the beginning of his quest has since evolved into a Fearow, and soon carries Ash and Pikachu away, where they discover that a flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto are being threatened by the Spearow flock. Ash sends his Pidgeotto to guide them to safety, but is attacked by Fearow. Determined to help Ash, Ash's Pidgeotto evolves into Pidgeot, and accompanies Ash and Pikachu to defeat Fearow. Ash subsequently releases Pidgeot to protect the wild Pidgey and Pidgeotto.</p>
